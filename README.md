# Compilers
During the course of ECE 351 Compilers at the University of Waterloo, I had to deliver 10 labs that focused in different aspects of a compiler. All of them involved programming with Java with an additional focus in some aspects that can be seen in Labs_description.png in this repository. According to the department policy, I may not share my solutions to this labs publicly as they are reused in future offerings of the course.


Grades obtained in each lab: [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 94, 100, 100]


**Lab 1:** Recursive Descent Parsing of W


**Lab 2:** Transforming W → SVG for Visualization


**Lab 3:** Recursive Descent Parsing of F


**Lab 4:** Circuit Optimization: F Simplifier


**Lab 5:** Parsing W with Parboiled


**Lab 6:** Parsing F with Parboiled


**Lab 7:** Technology Mapping: F → Graphviz


**Lab 8:** Simulation: F → Java


**Lab 11:** vhdl → vhdl: Desugaring & Elaboration


Note: Lab 9 and 10 were omitted during the Fall 23 offering of the course.
